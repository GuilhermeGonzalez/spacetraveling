  <h2>Ignite React Track Challenge</h2>
  <p align="left">Challenge proposed in the React track of Rocketseat's Ignite. In this challenge, we were asked to develop an application from scratch following the content provided to us in chapter 3.</p>
  <p align="left">The functionalities developed were: comments section, navigation between posts, information on whether the post was updated after its creation, and a post preview system where the content creator can see how the post will look on the application's page before publishing it.</p>
